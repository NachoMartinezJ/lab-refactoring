# Lab | Refactoring

## Description
Let's spend some time with your code now you know a little bit more about clean code and good practices.

## Instructions
* Fork this repository
* Add the code of your first project: the programming challenge. As it is, no changes! But now, you will change it to a Pythin script, it means if you have done it in a Jupyter notebook and before it was .ipynb now it's .py.
* Remember what you learnt at the lesson (good practices, clean code...)
* Refactor your code! 
* Do your PR. Then it should include: the project as you delivered it (but in a .py), and the same project but refactored.

## Some hints
* During the refactor, you should do some commits to explain your changes (what and why).
* Maybe you would want to use some different scripts instead of one.
